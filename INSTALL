Howto build and use the BitTorrent library
==========================================

Dependencies
------------

This is my personal adaptation of Turn's (http://www.turn.com) BitTorrent
library Ttorrent. In contrast to the original library sources, the sources
you are currently lurking through will build using the Apache Ant tool.

To successfully build the binary files, you need following software:
	* Apache Ant (tested with 1.8.2)
	* a functional Java compiler, everything up 1.6 should work
	  (tested with IceTea6 1.12.6, equivalent to java version 1.6.0_27)
	* apache-commons-io library (tested with version 2.4)
	* apache-commons-codec library (tested with version 1.8)
	* log4j library (tested with 1.2.16)
	* slf4j library (tested with 1.6.5)
	* simpleframework library (currently only working with 4.1.21!!!)
	* JArgs library (tested with release 1.0)

If you are missing one of those pieces, here are some project pages to fetch
them:

Apache Ant: http://ant.apache.org/srcdownload.cgi
OpenJDK: http://openjdk.java.net/
Oracle JDK: http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html
Apache-Commons: http://commons.apache.org/
log4j: http://logging.apache.org/log4j/1.2/download.html
slf4j: http://www.slf4j.org/
simpleframework: http://sourceforge.net/projects/simpleweb/
jargs: http://jargs.sourceforge.net/

... or you just install the missing parts through your systems package manager.



Building the binaries
-----------------------------

Building the binary files should be a easy as calling

	ant

from your commandline at the root folder of this project.
